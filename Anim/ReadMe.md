# Hello, World !!

## Welcome to a tiny directory in the ocean of repositories. A place, where I will keep sharing my way of thinking, my point of views & my learning.

### I am just a new learner in this field. Still traveling and a long way to go. Thank you for giving your precious time to reach into this place and reading up right until now.

### I have always been thinking there are many thought processes that we think knowingly or unknowingly. As world is growing through vastness of information, me as a passionate computer engineer would love to share my thought processes, my learning & my point of view related to the field where I fall passionate about.

### As I am in a growth and this growth has no ending. This directory shall grow with me. Thank you for coming all along and reading till now. It means a lot to this soul, and it wants to share a important thing - "Keep Learning, because this is the most driven force of human nature which keeps soul refreshed and alive." I have always felt it.

### Furthermore, even if a tiny bit of my writings help you to become a little bit knowledgeable then my writing has served it's purposes. Thank you very much for stopping by. Let's keep growing.
